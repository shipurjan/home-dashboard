This is a website for a live dashboard in my home
It's running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with only 512MB of RAM and is entirely static - it just displays some data like time, date, weather and timetables without user interaction on a 1050x1680 resolution

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
